Attributes
Filters, DisplayTable columns and Summary and Detail popups are controlled by enteries in the Attributes table 

Entity: Which data set the attribute exists on.  Current supported values are "Properties", "Reac", "RealProperty", "Subsidy"
Attribute: The table column name which contains the values to be filtered for this filter control.
IsFilter: Is this a filter in the filter panel? 1 = True, 0 = False.
OrderWithinCategory: Ascending order of all of the filters within a category.
Category: Text label of the category this filter should be rendered under.  Categories are created simply by making a filter which references one.
CategoryOrder: The order in which Categories will appear in the filter panel.
SubCategory:  Presently not used in this implementation.
OrderWithinSubCategory: Presently not used in this implementation.
IsNative:  If entity is Property, does this attribute exist on Properties_Primary (1) or Properties_Secondary (0).
TableDisplayName: For entity Property, the name to display on table view header.  If null, the attribute will not be availble to view on the table.
FilterDisplayName: The name to display on filter control.  Leave null if IsFilter is false.
Description: The text to be used for attribute tooltips (hove over the ? in the app).
UiType: If IsFilter, the type of UI control to render: dropdown (values from Attribute_Value table), free (free text entry), wildcard (free text entry that performs a %LIKE% query), range (numeric between or high/low range), date (calendar select control), daterange (date between or high/low range).
ValueType: The type of value the filter can expect, for validation.  Valid values: text, integer and date.
MinValue: If integer range type, the minimum value to accept.
MaxValue: If integer range type, the maximum value to accept.
GroupBy: Is this attribute allowed as a "group by" option, to perform aggregate unit/property counts on?
RequiredRole: Highest role required to view this attribute filter: public, limited, network, SysAdmin
DefaultTableDisplay:  Should this attribute be visibile by default in the table?
TableColumnOrder: The position of this column in the display table.
ShortViewOrder: The order this attribute should be shown on the map popup.  Null if it is not to be shown.
LongViewOrder: The order this attribute should be shown on the "More Details" popup.  Null if it is not to be shown.
Difficulty: Not used in this implementation

Attribute_Values
Filter dropdown values are populated from entries in the Attribute_Values table. An attribute would have as many rows as there should be dropdown values in the filter.

Attribute: The attribute name from table Attributes for which these values apply.
AttributeValue: An attribute value to select from.
AttributeGrouping: If the dropdown values should be grouped into sections, put the section title for this value here.

Users
Information on registered users to the system

Id: Autogenerated unique primary key.
Username: Unique text username.
Password: Hashed password for authentication.
Email: Registered email address.
Name: Full Name
Roles: List of roles assigned to this user.  public, limited (email verified), network, SysAdmin
EmailConfirmationToken: The token sent to the email on file to verify the email address is active.
EmailConfirmed: Has the verification link been activated?  Can set to true to manually verify email.
Organization: For a network user, the Id of the Organization they belong to.

Organizations
Network organization

Id: Autogenerated unique Id.
Name: Name of the organization.

Comments
Comments are given by a particular user for a particular property and set with an AccessLevel that determines who can view it.

Id: Autogenerated unique primary key.
Username: Textual user name from Users table.
NilhcId: Property Id from Properties_Primary.
AccessLevel: Instructions on who can view the comment.  Public (anyone), Network (any network user), SameOrg (any network user in the same org as poster).
Org: OrganizationId of poster, if SameOrg
Created: Timestamp of creationg
Modified: Timestamp of last edit
LastEditorId: The last userId who edited (sysAdmins can edit anything)
Image: Binary representation of uploaded image (optional)
Text: Text of comment issued.

UploadRevisions
To support rollbacks to previous versions of a data upload.  Properties_Primary, Subsidy, Parcel, RealProperty, Reac and Attributes can all be uploaded or exported.  Each new upload saves the csv contents with a given unique id.  This will support rolling back to a previously known good version if a bad version is uploaded and breaks functionality on the site.

Id: Unique Id specifiying the upload revision
Type: Data set which this entry corresponds to.
Date: Original Upload date
Data: CSV contents
UserId: User who initiated the upload.

ChildResouceRestrictions
Attributes in the Attributes table can be restricted on a per role level.  On the detailed popup window, we list the contents of related child records from Subsidy, Reac, Parcel and Real Property.  To display these datasets, they must have an entry in the table.

ChildResource: Which dataset:  ReacHistory, ParcelHistory, RealPropertyHistory, Subsidy
RoleForDisplay: Minimum required role for display to user: public, limited, network or SysAdmin

Properties_Primary, Subsidy, Parcel, RealProperty and Reac all match fairly close to the datasets your initially provided.
Properties_Secondary currently is not used for this implementation but can be used to host attributes with 1:M relationships that don't belong in other tables.
