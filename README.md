Urban Institute: DC Preservation 
=============================


The [Urban Institute](http://urban.org) has developed the DC Preservation Catalog, which is a database of affordable rental
properties in Washington, DC. Information on each property is drawn from a range of local and national
databases and information provided by partners in the DC Preservation Network, and is used to develop
strategies to preserve affordable housing options.

This is a ASP.NET application based off of previous work in developing the [Furman Center Data Search Tool](http://furmancenter.org/data/) to support the DC Preservation Catalog.
